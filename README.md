## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Ivi!

I'm a senior at Tufts University double majoring in Cognitive and Brain Science and Computer Science. I'm passionate about cognition and language processing research, with a focus on viewing the human brain through a computational, predictive-processing lens. Currently, I'm working on my Senior Honors Thesis, investigating how we integrate new information into our mental models of the world during conversations. On a daily basis, my main languages are R, MATLAB (ERPLAB), and Python.

Let's connect if you get nerdy about garden path sentences, bilingualism, and niche use cases for LLMs in neuroscience research!

(Most of my research scripts are not public yet because the research is still ongoing and/or not cleared for me to publish yet :))
